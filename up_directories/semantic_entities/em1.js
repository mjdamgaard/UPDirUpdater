// First entity module (EM) with some initial entities, not least the
// 'Entities' class and the 'Classes' class which are fundamental to the
// whole semantic system.




// Class of all things, all 'entities.' Entities are defined/represented by
// objects of the kind you see below, namely with capitalized property names,
// and always with a "Class" property. We will tend to refer to these defining
// properties of entities as their 'attributes.'
// It should be noted that all these 'attributes' of an entity are not set in
// stone. Any attribute can be overridden by what we can call 'scored
// properties,' which are properties determined by the users when they score
// the 'relations' that are introduced below. So all the attributes that you
// see below are in principle only the "initial" or "default" ones. And their
// job is thus only to specify what thing or concept is being referred to, as
// well as possibly to declare some metadata properties that the app might use
// as default options.
// Entities will often refer to a real-world things or concepts, or things/
// concepts relating to this semantic and/or user-programmable system. But they
// can also be self-contained objects that just refers to themselves. Such
// objects will often carry 'methods' as part of their attributes, the names for
// which we will tend to use lower camel case (as in e.g. 'fetchScoreData'),
// making these entities able to be treated similarly to objects from an OOP
// language.
// The values of the attributes can be anything such as strings and numbers,
// and methods as just mentioned, and can also paths leading to such data. And
// most importantly, they can be the "keys" of other entities. Such entity keys
// can either be paths to the entity's definition object (as seen e.g. for all
// "Class" attributes defined below), or they can be strings of the form
// '#<entID>' or just '<entID>', where entID (entity ID) is a hexadecimal
// string that is assigned to the entity when uploading it via the
// ./entities.sm.js server module. They can also be of the form '@<userID>',
// where userID is the hexadecimal string that the backend uses in order to
// identify users.
// The kind of values to expect for each attributes and their interpretations
// should be defined by the class's description. But unless otherwise specified,
// it should be the convention to escape '#' and '@' characters in string-
// valued attributes, as well as leading '/'s, using backslashes for doing so,
// unless these are to be interpreted as part of an entity key and/or a path.

// A 'quality' in this system refers to a property of an entity that can be
// described by floating-point number within some range. One can think of the
// well-known "tags" that you normally see on the web, but where each tag is
// rated on a floating-point scale. For example, a movie  might be rated with
// respect to a quality of "Scary," and the rating scale of the quality would
// thus represent how scary the movie is.
// The scores given to the qualities can then to be aggregated into e.g. mean
// or median estimators over larger user groups. Such user groups do not need
// to include all users of the system, but can also be a limited list of users.
// (And the users in the group might even have different weights, meaning that
// the scores of some might count for more than others.)
// Qualities have a "Label" attribute, which should be as brief as possible:
// Instead of writing "Is scary," write "Scary." And instead of writing "Has
// good acting," write "Good acting." Then for elaboration on these labels,
// qualities also have a "getElaboration" attribute (a method), which takes a
// the subject of the quality as its argument, and returns a more elaborative
// label. For example, getElaboration() could be subj => subj + " is scary", or
// subj => subj + " has good acting." And then we of course also have the
// "Description" attribute for further elaboration. 
// Apart from that, semantic qualities also each have a "Domain," which is a
// class to which the subjects are supposed to belong. (It can also be a
// quality, in which case it is implicitly understood to mean that set of all
// entities with a positive score for that quality). They also have a "Metric,"
// which defines the semantics of the range of the floating-point score, and
// they can have a (default) "Area of concern" attribute, which, as described
// below, helps the app choose the right user group to query for score
// aggregates for the given quality.
// Some qualities might also have the "Area of concern" attribute replaced with
// a "Formula" attribute. In this case, we might refer to the quality as a
// 'derived quality.' The "Formula" attribute takes the value of a function,
// whose only argument is a so-called 'score handler' (see below), which in
// short is an object that handles fetching (and posting) scores for the given
// user, allowing the results to be dependent on the user's own preferences.
// The returned value of the "Formula" function is then an object with the same
// API (in terms of its methods) as the so-called "scored lists," which are

/* An inserted note about using AoCs to achieve anonymity for users: */
// Areas of concern can furthermore also be used as a way to achieve almost
// perfect user anonymity, while at the same time being able to assign trust to
// anonymous users. Here's how that can work. The system is made open towards
// creating several user profiles with the same e-mail address, and this is so
// for a reason. We want users to create several profiles, namely for different
// areas of concern. A user can then have a sort of "main" profile, either a
// public one, which can be confirmed as a real person via a friend-of-a-friend
// (FoaF) network (similar to Facebook and what have you, and Facebook might
// potentially be used for this FoaF network to some extend), or the "main" user
// profile can also be a private one that is nonetheless able to garner trust
// among the user network. But regardless of whether your "main" profile is
// public or not, you don't necessarily want it connected to all your other
// opinions about everything. Be it political opinions or opinions about
// sensitive things like pornography and sexual matters. Or you might want a
// private account to share and discuss secrets and/or private experiences with
// others. Or you even just might not want, say, your boss and your coworkers,
// and everyone else that you know, to know all your tastes in movies, free
// time activities, and all other things.
// But if you just create a new anonymous profile for this, how will people
// know that you are not just a bot (a concern that is more relevant than ever
// with AI bots taking over the web)? Well, they can if you connect the new
// profile privately (using private data tables) to your main profile, with
// respect to a given user group, such that others only get to see that the new
// profile is connected to *some* profile that is part of the given user group,
// and what approximate weight that profile has in that user group (they can't
// know the precise wight as that might out the exact profile).
// This can indeed be achieved, but then comes the question: How to prevent
// users from just creating a horde of other profiles in order to boost their
// opinions in the network? By making sure that the new profiles can't score
// the same qualities as the "main"  profile or any of the other profiles that
// is connected to it. And that is what the 'areas of concern' is used for in
// this regard. Each profile needs to select a set of areas of concern,
// possibly just one, when it connects to other profiles this way. And the
// areas of concern will be publicly known for each profile such that the user
// community can make sure that the profile does not score something that is
// unrelated to those areas, or just not aggregate the scores if they are.
// And when the user profiles connect with a "main" profile, you make sure to
// store the selected areas of concern, and make sure they don't overlap with
// any of the ones that are already chosen, by the "main" profile or by others
// that has previously been connected to it.
// And how to decide if two areas overlap? Simply by querying a 'Overlaps with'
// relation (with some appropriate user group to decide this), and checking
// that the score here is below a certain threshold (and with a high enough
// combined weight).
// And there we go, this is how users can get near perfect anonymity, while
// still making it possible for the user network to prevent bots posing as
// humans to a very great extend, and from users duplicating their scores.
// (And the UP node will of course also sign contracts not to read private data
// such as the data stored for connecting the profiles, now and in the future,
// and even if they are somehow not able to sign such contracts, there are
// still encryption schemes that you can implement to make sure that they also
// can't read the data, namely by using client-side encryption keys to encrypt
// the data.)





// 'Relations' in this system are entities that when combined with a relational
// object yields a quality (usually as predicate, but in principle it could
// also be other kinds of qualities). In practical terms, this is done by using
// the constructor if the 'Relational qualities' class below, RQ(), giving it
// the object and the relation as its arguments.
// Like qualities, relations also have a "getElaboration" attribute, but in this
// case, the function takes both an object and a subject as its second argument.
// For instance, we could have (obj, subj) => subj + " is a subclass of " + obj,
// which will indeed be the getElaboration() function of the "Subclasses"
// relation below.
// And like qualities, relations also have a "Label attribute, where we in this
// case prefer the labels to be nouns (including compound ones). This could for
// example be "Subclasses" in the case that we just saw. When a relational
// quality is created from an object and a relation, we can then give it a
// short label of the form "<Object> → <Relation>". So for instance, the
// quality of being a subclass of the "Texts" class will get the label of:
// "Texts → Subclasses." (By the way, plural nouns are often preferred for
// relation labels, unless they are expected to only have one subject, such as
// e.g. the the capital of a country, in which case the label ought to be
// "Capitol".)
// Relations also define the "Metric" and "Area of concern" of the relational
// qualities that they produce, as well as the domain, only this is referred to
// to as the "Subject domain" here, as we also similarly have an "Object
// domain" for the intended objects of the relation. The can also be 'derived'
// and use a "Formula" attribute rather than an "Area of concern." The only
// difference is that these "Formula" functions, as opposed the those of
// qualities, also take the object as their first argument, before the score
// handler argument.
